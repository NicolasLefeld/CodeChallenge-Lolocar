## Use information

You will find:
* [env.example](env.example) with some default variables.
  * U'll access the variables with process.env.VARIABLE_NAME
* MongoDB connection in this [file](db/dbConnection.js)
  * Basic MongoDB connection
* Router example [here](routers/example.js)
  * First you need to add the path to the server.js and then create the router
* Mongoose schema example [here](schemas/example.js)
  * The schemas for MongoDB to work
* Util file example [here](utils/example.js)
  * WHere the functions of an specific process are stored
* A nice an simple [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
  * Run "docker build --tag dockerImageNameHere ." and then u'll have the image stored.
  * Run "docker images" to check it!
  * Now you have the image. Then you will need to run it with "docker run" or create a docker-compose (I recomend the second option)

## Some recomendations
* Use nodemon!
* If you need to paginate responses, try to use mongoose-paginate
* Use eslint, its a file formater. You'll use a comercial format style, like the one used on [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
* Store the dates with unix time format on the DB
* If you need to work with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. Check [lodash](https://lodash.com/)!
* Use Morgan. It's a good tool for debuging.

## Information about the technologies used
* Node JS
  * It's a environment of execution for JavaScript, based on on the V8 engine of Chrome.
  * Lightweight, efficient and fast! 
  * **Asynchronous and Event Driven** – it means that API call doesn't wait for results and doesn't block other calls. After it finish executing it will run an callback or notify about certain execution parts using events. Even though Node.js is running on single thread with event looping, it can handle more requests than, for example Apache HTTP server, because of using asynchronous non-blocking way of handling code execution.
* Express
  * It's a framework that provides a lot of tools for server handling. Setting up a server, routers, etc.
* MongoDB
  * Non-SQL DataBase
* Mongoose
  * It's a module for MongoDB that'll give you the posibility to work with schemas. That means that the objects that'll store on the DB, will follow that schema that you previously define.
* Docker
  * With Docker you'll have the power of making docker images, then run them on containers!. That means that you just need to have a Dockerfile, generate the image then with the image you can run it in a container, isolated from the rest of the system.
